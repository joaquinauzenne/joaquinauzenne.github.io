## 👋 About Me

I am a researcher and computational biologist with dual B.S. degrees in **Mathematics** and **Computational Biology** from the University of Texas at Austin. My work bridges **bioinformatics**, **predictive modeling**, and **molecular biology**, with applications in environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis, high-throughput genomics, and translational biotechnology.  

I am passionate about creating **data-driven solutions** that transform complex biological data into actionable insights, and I enjoy building reproducible pipelines, databases, and visualization tools to support collaborative research.
