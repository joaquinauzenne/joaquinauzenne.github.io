Hello and welcome! 👋 I'm Joaquin — a recent graduate ('25) from the **University of Texas at Austin** with a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.S. in Computational Biology.

I'm an interdisciplinary scientist focused on engineering high-fidelity solutions for complex biological systems. My work treats biological data as a mathematical landscape to be decoded through predictive modeling and robust pipeline engineering.

I support **open science** and the FAIR principles: scientific data should be **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, and **R**eusable for all.
