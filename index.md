Hello and welcome! 👋 I'm Joaquin — a recent graduate ('25) from the **University of Texas at Austin** with a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.S. in Computational Biology, along with a Certificate in Scientific Computation and Data Sciences.

I'm an interdisciplinary scientist focused on engineering high-fidelity solutions for complex biological systems. My work treats biological data as a mathematical landscape to be decoded through predictive modeling and robust pipeline engineering — whether building eDNA metabarcoding workflows for conservation, designing metabolic pathways for sustainable chemistry, or forecasting pharmaceutical logistics.

I'm currently interested in metabarcoding for conservation and species identification, the evolution of language in primates and neurolinguistics, and tackling hard interdisciplinary problems through applications of mathematics — statistics, modeling, analysis, and beyond.

I support **open science** and the FAIR principles: scientific data should be **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, and **R**eusable for all. I'm always looking to collaborate on exciting research projects!

*Pronouns: he / him  ·  ⚡ I love learning languages through music, film, and reading!*
