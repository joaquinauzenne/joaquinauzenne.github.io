## Overview

Conducted at the Department of Integrative Biology, University of Texas at Austin (Oct – Dec 2024).

## Objectives

- Model spatiotemporal dynamics of U.S. COVID-19 spread across counties and states
- Identify transmission hubs using weighted network centrality measures
- Build interactive tools to communicate findings for public health decision-making

## Methods

- **Data:** 32M U.S. COVID-19 cases (April 2020 – April 2021)
- **Modeling:** Spatial network time-series models in R
- **Network Analysis:** Weighted network centrality metrics to identify transmission hubs
- **Visualization:** Shiny interactive maps, dashboards, and summary statistics
- **Application:** Insights intended to inform targeted public health interventions
