## Overview

Conducted at FRI EvoDevOmics, University of Texas at Austin (Jan 2022 – Sept 2023).

## Objectives

- Characterize the transcriptomic basis of embryonic diversification across frog species
- Build reproducible, high-throughput preprocessing and analysis pipelines
- Validate biological process terms for differentially expressed genes through automated literature mining

## Methods

- **Sequencing:** Next-generation sequencing (RNA-Seq) data processed on BRCF HPC clusters
- **Pipeline:** Preprocessing, QC, and alignment pipelines built in R (SLURM)
- **Differential Expression:** DESeq2 and WGCNA for co-expression network analysis
- **Literature Mining:** Python tool IdMiner via PaperBLAST (PubMed, NCBI) to validate 40+ DEG biological process annotations
- **Teaching:** Served as TA for a 20+ student computational biology course on NGS, FAIR data, and 'omics analysis
