## Overview

Conducted at Henard Lab, University of North Texas BioDiscovery Institute (Feb 2020 – May 2021).

## Objectives

- Design a synthetic shikimate biosynthesis pathway for heterologous expression in *E. coli*
- Demonstrate feasibility of "green chemistry" alternative nylon production using methane as feedstock
- Communicate findings to a broader audience through science writing

## Methods

- **Molecular Biology:** Gibson assembly for plasmid construction and modification of *E. coli*
- **Bioreactor Design:** Scalable methane-fed bioreactor for muconic acid / nylon precursor production
- **Pathway Engineering:** Rational design based on "Muconic acid production from methane using rationally-engineered methanotrophic biocatalysts" (Henard et al.)
- **Science Communication:** Adapted primary research for *Frontiers for Young Minds* to make metabolic engineering accessible to younger audiences
- **Funding:** Awarded $500 grant for project design and execution
