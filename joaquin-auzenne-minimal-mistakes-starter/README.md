## 👋 About Me

I am a researcher and computational biologist with dual B.S. degrees in **Mathematics** and **Computational Biology** from the University of Texas at Austin. My work bridges **bioinformatics**, **predictive modeling**, and **molecular biology**, with applications in environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis, high-throughput genomics, and translational biotechnology.

I create **reproducible pipelines** and **interactive tools** that turn complex biological data into actionable insight for collaborators across disciplines.

## 🔬 Research Experience

- **Bioinformatic Assistant — DiFiore Lab, UT Austin**  
  Built a **mammalian eDNA metabarcoding pipeline** for Nanopore MinION data (Cutadapt → NGSpeciesID → BLAST+), integrated **NCBI** and **GBIF** for taxonomic identification and range visualization, and assembled a 12S/16S **reference library** for Colombian mammals.

- **Undergraduate Researcher & Mentor — EvoDevOmics, UT Austin**  
  Designed **transcriptomic pipelines** on SLURM clusters to study embryonic diversification in frogs; TA for 20+ students focusing on NGS, FAIR data stewardship, and data visualization.

- **Data Analysis Intern — Tanel Health (Dakar, SN)**  
  Implemented **XGBoost/SARIMA** forecasting for pharmaceutical inventory optimization; shipped **QR-based** prescription authentication; wrote technical reports for stakeholders.

- **Metabolic Engineering Research — Henard Lab, UNT**  
  Engineered *E. coli* metabolic pathways for nylon-precursor production in methane-fed bioreactors; translated research for *Frontiers for Young Minds*.
