## Overview
Developed and implemented a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline for environmental DNA analysis to assess **mammalian biodiversity** in Colombia's **Magdalena River Valley** ecosystem. Demonstrates advanced data processing, database integration, and statistical analysis skills applicable to large-scale data science challenges.

### Big Data Processing
- Built a **scalable Python-based pipeline** to process high-throughput genomic data from **Nanopore MinION**, handling **millions of DNA sequences**.

### Database Integration
- Integrated and queried **GBIF** and **NCBI GenBank** (10M+ records across taxa) for comprehensive taxonomic identification.

### Algorithm Implementation
- Developed consensus sequence clustering workflows and **BLAST+**-based taxonomic alignment, optimizing for accuracy and compute efficiency.

### Data Visualization
- Created **interactive species range maps** and **phylogenetic visualizations** to communicate complex findings to scientific stakeholders.

### Relevant Technologies
R, Python, Git, Linux, SQL databases, BLAST+, data visualization, ad-hoc statistics.

### Impact
Improves accuracy of species identification from ONT data via **consensus-based error correction** and robust taxonomic assignment. Enhances biodiversity monitoring for ecosystems like the Magdalena River Valley while establishing reproducible **HPC-friendly** workflows bridging molecular ecology and computational biology.
