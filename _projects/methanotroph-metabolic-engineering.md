## Overview

This project explored using methane-consuming bacteria (*Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum*) and engineered *E. coli* as biocatalysts for producing shikimate — a key precursor in the biosynthesis of nylon intermediates — as a sustainable alternative to petroleum-based chemical production. The work was conducted at the UNT BioDiscovery Institute under Dr. Calvin Henard and included a science communication component adapting research findings for a young audience.

## Methods / Approach

- Designed a heterologous shikimate biosynthesis pathway by identifying and selecting enzyme-coding genes for introduction into a *E. coli* plasmid construct.
- Performed Gibson Assembly to construct the multi-insert plasmid and validated assembly by sequencing and colony PCR.
- Conducted qRT-PCR to assess transcript levels of inserted pathway genes under methane-feeding conditions in the bioreactor system.
- Adapted the Henard Lab's published research (*Muconic acid production from methane using rationally-engineered methanotrophic biocatalysts*) into a plain-language article for *Frontiers for Young Minds* — a peer-reviewed journal targeting readers aged 8–15.

## Key Results

- Successfully assembled and verified the target plasmid construct containing the shikimate pathway insert.
- qRT-PCR confirmed transcription of inserted genes under experimental growth conditions.
- *Frontiers for Young Minds* adaptation submitted, translating enzyme engineering and green chemistry concepts for a lay audience.
- Awarded $500 in internal research funding for project proposal and preliminary results.
