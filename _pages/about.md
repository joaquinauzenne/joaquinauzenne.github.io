## Interdisciplinary Scientist | B.S. Mathematics & Computational Biology | Polymathic Scholar

I am a dual-degree scientist from the University of Texas at Austin (May 2025) focused on engineering high-fidelity solutions for complex biological systems. My work is defined by an analytical rigor that treats biological data not just as a series of observations, but as a mathematical landscape to be decoded through predictive modeling and robust pipeline engineering — whether designing metabolic pathways for sustainable green chemistry or building scalable bioinformatics workflows for environmental DNA.

Beyond the formal framing above, I'm someone who genuinely loves hard interdisciplinary problems. I support **open science** and the FAIR principles: all scientific data should be **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, and **R**eusable.

🔭 My previous research as included:
- **Metabarcoding** for conservation efforts and species identification
- Uncovering differential patterns in frog embryonic development through **transcriptomics**
- And more generally: tackling hard **interdisciplinary problems** through applications of mathematics

🌱 In my 'free' time, I'm reading **The Dialectical Biologist by Richard Levins and Richard Lewontin**, **Functional Analysis for the Applied Mathematician by Todd Arbogast**, and re-exploring biological sequence analysis pipelines with agentic AI to sharpen my bioinformatics toolkit.

👯 I'm looking to **collaborate** on exciting research projects in any field where I may apply my curiosity!

💬 Ask me about **Biological Modeling**, **Applied Mathematics**, **Philosophy**, or anything else!

😄 Pronouns: **He / him**

⚡ Fun fact: I love learning languages through new music, film, conversation, and reading — my Spotify is a happy mess as a result!
