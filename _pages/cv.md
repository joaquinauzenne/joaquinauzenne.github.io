## Experience

### Bioinformatic Assistant
**DiFiore Lab, University of Texas at Austin** — Austin, TX | Dec 2024 – Present
- Engineered an end-to-end mammalian metabarcoding pipeline for Oxford Nanopore MinION-sequenced environmental DNA (83 soil samples, ~6M reads), correcting random ONT errors to achieve >99% consensus accuracy.
- Integrated multiple public domain databases (GBIF, NCBI, IUCN) for comprehensive species identification via phylogenetic analysis and species range visualization with ArcGIS.
- Established a DNA reference library for mammals identified along the Magdalena River in Colombia, focusing on rRNA genetic markers (12S, 16S).

### Undergraduate Researcher & Mentor
**FRI EvoDevOmics, University of Texas at Austin** — Austin, TX | Jan 2022 – Sept 2023
- Designed high-throughput transcriptomic pipelines (preprocessing, QC, alignment) in R on BRCF clusters to reveal the basis of embryonic diversification in frogs via differential gene expression analyses (DESeq2, WGCNA).
- Developed **IdMiner**, a Python tool using BeautifulSoup to automate literature searches across 1M+ scientific papers in the PaperBLAST database (PubMed, NCBI), validating biological process terms for 40+ differentially expressed genes.
- Served as TA for a computational biology course of 20+ students focused on NGS, 'omics data analysis, FAIR resource stewardship, and career readiness.

### Data Analysis Intern
**Tanel Health** — Dakar, Senegal | May 2023 – Aug 2023
- Implemented gradient boosting and regression (XGBoost, SARIMA) on pharmaceutical sales data (1.1M records) on AWS, improving inventory forecasting and reducing waste by up to 20% across 200+ in-network enterprises.
- Created technical reports justifying predictive model selections to shareholders with associated performance metrics.
- Digitized prescriptions and integrated a two-factor QR-based authentication system for a 10,000+ customer database.

### CNC Machinist & Programmer
**Carr Lane Manufacturing** | Prior to 2022
- Developed and maintained SOPs and maintenance logs for precision CNC machining operations.
- Increased production output by 24+ hours per week through programmed overnight production runs.
- Applied a manufacturing mindset emphasizing operational discipline, precision, and preventive maintenance.

### Student Researcher
**Henard Lab, University of North Texas BioDiscovery Institute** — Denton, TX | Feb 2020 – May 2021
- Awarded $500 to design a shikimate biosynthesis pathway for plasmid-modified *E. coli* (Gibson assembly) for green-chemistry alternative nylon production in a scalable methane-fed bioreactor.
- Adapted "Muconic acid production from methane using rationally-engineered methanotrophic biocatalysts" (Henard et al.) for *Frontiers for Young Minds*, translating advanced metabolic engineering concepts for a broader audience.
