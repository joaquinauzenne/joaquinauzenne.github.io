## Research Experience

### Bioinformatic Assistant
**DiFiore Lab, University of Texas at Austin** — Austin, TX | Dec 2024 – Present
- Developed a mammalian metabarcoding pipeline for pre-processing and consensus sequence clustering of Nanopore MinION-sequenced environmental DNA (83 soil samples, ~6M reads) in Shell script for taxonomic assignment via BLAST+.
- Integrated multiple public domain databases (NCBI, IUCN) using the GBIF Metabarcoding Data Toolkit API for comprehensive species identification and interactive species-range visualization with ArcGIS.
- Established a curated DNA reference library of mammals identified along the Magdalena River in Colombia, focusing on rRNA genetic markers (12S, 16S).
- Delivered consensus sequences ready for longitudinal population and dispersal analyses using MinION MKICN Nanopore sequencing, MultiQC, NGSpeciesID read clustering, and megaBLAST taxonomic assignment.

### Undergraduate Researcher & Teaching Mentor
**FRI EvoDevOmics, University of Texas at Austin** — Austin, TX | Jan 2022 – Sept 2023
- Designed high-throughput transcriptomic pipelines (preprocessing, QC, alignment) in R on BRCF HPC clusters to reveal the basis of embryonic diversification in *Dendrobatid* frogs via differential gene expression analyses (DESeq2, WGCNA, PCA, nearest-neighbors clustering).
- Co-developed **IdMiner**, a Python-based academic literature search tool querying PubMed and NCBI repositories to functionally annotate 40+ differentially expressed genes at scale.
- Served as Teaching Assistant for a computational biology course of 20+ students covering NGS, 'omics data analysis, FAIR digital resource stewardship, and career readiness under Rebecca Young, PhD.
- Presented weekly lessons on statistical methods (MANOVA, PCA, WGCNA) to student cohorts, translating complex bioinformatic concepts for undergraduate audiences.

### Undergraduate Research Assistant
**Henard Lab, University of North Texas BioDiscovery Institute** — Denton, TX | Feb 2020 – May 2021
- Awarded $500 competitive grant to design a shikimate biosynthesis pathway in plasmid-modified *E. coli* (Gibson assembly) as a "green chemistry" alternative for nylon precursor production in a scalable methane-fed bioreactor.
- Maintained *E. coli* and methanotrophic cultures; evaluated methane production within continuous-stirred tank reactors; performed qRT-PCR confirmation of engineered shikimate-pathway constructs.
- Conducted daily hood upkeep, sterility checks, liquid chromatography analysis, and detailed laboratory record-keeping.
- Adapted "Muconic acid production from methane using rationally-engineered methanotrophic biocatalysts" (Henard et al.) for *Frontiers for Young Minds*, translating advanced metabolic engineering concepts for a younger audience.

### Reptile Care & Research Assistant
**Crossley Lab, University of North Texas Integrative Biology** — Denton, TX | Oct 2019 – Jun 2020
- Oversaw daily feeding, tank maintenance, and husbandry for 30+ tanks of large laboratory reptiles (*Alligator mississippiensis*, *Chelydra serpentina*); provided on-call emergency support including animal restraint, transport, and surgical assistance.
- Conducted cardiorespiratory physiological study of alligators and snapping turtles birthed under normoxic and hypoxic conditions via controlled treadmill exercise and blood gas centrifugation.
