- title: "Mammalian eDNA Metabarcoding Pipeline & Visualization Platform"
  org: "DiFiore Lab · UT Austin · Dec 2024–Present"
  desc: "Senior thesis: end-to-end Bash pipeline processing ~6M Nanopore reads from 83 soil samples (Magdalena River Valley, Colombia), achieving >99% consensus accuracy through ONT error correction. Paired with an interactive ArcGIS web platform presenting species-range data for both scientific and public audiences."

- title: "COVID-19 Spatiotemporal Network Dynamics"
  org: "Dept. of Integrative Biology · UT Austin · Oct–Dec 2024"
  desc: "Built spatial network time-series models of U.S. COVID-19 spread (32M cases, Apr 2020–Apr 2021) with R/Shiny interactive maps, dashboards, and weighted network centrality statistics to identify transmission hubs and inform public health intervention strategies."
  tags: [R / Shiny, Network Analysis, Time Series, Epidemiology]

- title: "IdMiner — Bioinformatic Literature Search Tool"
  org: "FRI EvoDevOmics · UT Austin · 2022"
  desc: "Co-developed a Python tool using BeautifulSoup to automate academic literature searches across 1M+ papers in PaperBLAST (PubMed, NCBI), enabling scalable functional annotation of differentially expressed gene lists. Applied to validate 40+ DEGs from <em>Dendrobatid</em> frog transcriptomics."
